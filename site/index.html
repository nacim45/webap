          <p id="description5"><b>Tennis, a widely celebrated sport, encompasses a unique blend of athleticism and strategy. Played on a court divided by a net, participants engage in a dynamic exchange, wielding rackets to propel a ball back and forth with precision. Central to the essence of tennis is the goal of outmaneuvering opponents through strategic shot placement and tactical foresight.
            At its core, tennis demands a fusion of physical agility and mental acuity. Players must demonstrate swift footwork, agility, and endurance to navigate the court effectively, coupled with quick reflexes to respond to the rapid pace of play. Fundamental to the sport are the mastery of basic strokes, such as the forehand, backhand, volley, and serve, alongside the cultivation of court positioning and footwork. 
            Beyond its physical aspects, tennis instills values of sportsmanship, integrity, and mutual respect. Ultimately, tennis serves as a platform for personal growth, fostering discipline, resilience, and camaraderie among players of all levels.</b></p>

      <h3><b>Did you know ?</b></h3>
      <p><b>Did you know that tennis balls were originally white?<br>
      It wasn't until 1972 that tennis balls were first introduced in the bright fluorescent color known as 'optic yellow'.<br> 
      This change was made to improve visibility for players and spectators alike, especially on television broadcasts.<br>
      The introduction of yellow tennis balls revolutionized the sport, making it easier to track the ball's movement during fast-paced matches.</b></p>
