        Proper technique is essential for a successful serve, involving a coordinated motion of the entire body, including the legs, hips, shoulders, and arms. 
        Timing, balance, and rhythm are critical components, as they contribute to generating power and accuracy on the serve. </b></p>

    <h3><b>Did you know ?</b></h3>
    <p><b>Did you know that in the past decade, professional tennis has witnessed some incredible serve records?<br>
        Among them is the remarkable achievement of John Isner, who holds the record for the most aces served in a single match. <br>
        In 2010, during an epic Wimbledon encounter against Nicolas Mahut, Isner fired an astonishing 113 aces<br>
        This marathon match, spanning three days and lasting a staggering 11 hours and 5 minutes, remains the longest in tennis history.
